        "## **Explanation**\n",
        "In this code, we are using the Gradio library to create a simple web interface for users to select and view short stories from a predefined collection.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Key Steps**\n",
        "\n",
        "1.   **Importing the Gradio Library:** which helps in creating user-friendly interfaces to interact with machine learning models or simple functions like the one in this code.\n",
        "2.   **Defining a Dictionary of Stories:** Python dictionary where each key is the title of a story, and the value is the actual text of the story. We have four stories: \"Friendship,\" \"Adventure,\" \"Success,\" and \"Family.\"\n",
        "3. **Creating the Story Selection Function:** we define a function get_story that takes the selected story title as input and returns the corresponding story from the stories dictionary.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Building the Gradio Interface:**\n",
        "This is where we build the Gradio interface:\n",
        "*   fn=get_story: This tells Gradio which function to call when the user interacts with the interface.\n",
        "*   inputs=gr.Dropdown: This creates a dropdown menu with options from the stories dictionary. The user can select a story title from this dropdown.\n",
