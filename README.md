# Short Story Generation Project using Hugging Face and Gradio

## Project Description
This project aims to develop an application that dynamically generates short stories based on a title entered by the user and the selection of an appropriate model for text generation. The project leverages pre-trained models from Hugging Face and allows the user to experiment with different AI models to create creative text outputs in an interactive way.

## Features:
•⁠  ⁠*Title Input*: Users can input a story title that they want the AI to generate a story around.
•⁠  ⁠*Model Selection*: The application allows users to choose from a variety of pre-trained models available on Hugging Face (such as GPT-2 or others) for text generation.
•⁠  ⁠*Story Generation*: Based on the entered title and the chosen model, the AI generates a suitable short story.
•⁠  ⁠*Simple User Interface*: Gradio is used to create a simple and interactive interface where users can easily interact with the model by entering data and selecting options.

## Tools and Technologies:
•⁠  ⁠*Hugging Face*: Utilizing pre-trained models for powerful text generation capabilities.
•⁠  ⁠*Gradio*: Creating an interactive interface that allows easy title input and model selection.
•⁠  ⁠*Python*: The main programming language used to connect the components and perform story generation.
•⁠  ⁠*GitHub*: For managing and sharing the project with the community.
